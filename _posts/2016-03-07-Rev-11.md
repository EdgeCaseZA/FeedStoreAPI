The [documentation](/FeedStoreAPI/docs) was updated to the latest revision: 11

Some changes to be aware of:

- the API is currently available on both `http` and `https`, all consumers should
  change their endpoint urls to make use of SSL since the insecure `http` protocol 
  will be redirected to `https` at some time in the near future
