The [documentation](/FeedStoreAPI/docs) was updated to the latest revision: 15

Non-breaking addition: Permitting additional file types in the Documents node on a listing.

- We now allow any of the following file types to be included in the Documents node: `.pdf .jpg .jpeg .png .xls .xlsx .doc .docx`
- This may be useful for clients who have a need to cater for different file types for documents on their websites. _An example would be floor plans that can now be sent through as images instead of a .pdf file._
